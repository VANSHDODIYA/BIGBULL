PROBLEM STATEMNET :-
Many retail investors build stock portfolios without a structured approach to diversification, risk management, or fundamental analysis. As a result, their investments may be overexposed to certain sectors, vulnerable to market volatility, or lack long-term stability. Existing tools are often complex or lack personalized insights tailored to small investors.
SOLUTION :-
We propose an AI-based Stock Portfolio Evaluation Assistant that analyzes a userâ€™s portfolio description or holdings and provides:
Feedback on sector diversification
Risk factor identification (e.g., lack of stop-loss or volatility awareness)
Insights on missing fundamental or technical analysis technique
Suggestions for stock inclusion based on current trends and indices
The tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse portfolio inputs and highlight strengths and gaps, providing actionable suggestions to help investors build more balanced and resilient portfolios.
